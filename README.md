# Scripts

These are a few scripts I built in the past. Maybe they are useful to somebody.
Otherwise this is just another backup of them in the *Cloud*.

## Overview

### remote-ytdl

If your ISP limits your bandwidth to YouTube, this is the script for you.
It downloads the file on a remote server with (hopefully) maximum speed
and them transfers the file from there to your computer.

## License

Do what you want with them. Just give credit somewhere. Think of a BSD License.
