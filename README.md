# Scripts

These are a few scripts I built in the past. Maybe they are useful to somebody.
Otherwise this is just another backup of them in the *Cloud*.

## Overview

### remote-ytdl

If your ISP limits your bandwidth to YouTube, this is the script for you.
It downloads the file on a remote server with (hopefully) maximum speed
and them transfers the file from there to your computer.

### scup

You want to show your screen to somebody. You don't need VNC/TeamViewer.

A screenshot often tells the story good enough. Use this script to upload
a screenshot to your server and copy the link to the clipboard.

No more failed IM file transfers. As a bonus it can not only automatically
upload all the screenshots in a location but every file you tell it to upload.

## License

Do what you want with them. Just give credit somewhere. Think of a BSD License.
